# 3. dotfiles manager

Date: 2022-03-04

## Context

Install each dotfiles folder and file by hand is a terrible option. Thus I need
a tool to automate this process.

## Decision

[rcm][1]. Beside the option of creating my own tool, many other options exist.
rcm is one of them. Because I used many time already and it works. I will stick
with it.

## Consequences

It can be installed in different environment. This decision affects the way I
structure my dotfiles. But I do not see any downside, at this time.
