# 4. UNIX Shell

Date: 2022-03-06

## Context

I used to [Zsh][1] over bash. However, I heard [fish][2] is a good option. I will
investigate and ensure to document any reason why it is worth switch from Zsh to
fish.

## Decision

The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement.

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
