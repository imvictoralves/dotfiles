# 2. Text Editor

Date: 2022-03-04

## Context

I must have an editor. It must work to edit code as well as text. It must work
on multiple platforms. It should be light weight, preferable if does not require
graphics. It should work remotely with minimal overhead.

## Decision

[Neovim][1]. It is similar to vi and vim. It offers more flexibility than vim.
But it keeps compatibility.

## Consequences

Because I am still getting used to keystroke shortcut of vim, this is still a
slower option. But it does comply with the other decision drivers. Some
extensions might be more difficult to install than on other editor.
